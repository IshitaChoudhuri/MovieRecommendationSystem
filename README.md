# Movie Recommender System

This project is a content-based movie recommender system that utilizes machine learning methods, including collaborative and content-based filtering, to provide users with personalized movie suggestions based on their preferences and viewing history.

## Project Overview

The project covers the following key topics:
- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Collaborative Filtering
- Content-Based Filtering
- Recommendation Engine
- User Interface Development
- Deployment and Hosting

## Deployment

The system has not been deployed since there were some issues with the Heroku platform

## How it Works

The system uses cosine similarity to recommend movies based on their similarity to the ones that a user has liked in the past. It utilizes item metadata such as genre, director, description, and actors to make these recommendations.
